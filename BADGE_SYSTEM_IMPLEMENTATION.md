# Badge System and Streak Fix Implementation

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Automatic Badge Awarding System

**New Functions Added to `src/lib/supabase.ts`:**

- `getBadgeByName()` - Fetches badge details by name
- `hasUserEarnedBadge()` - Checks if user already has a specific badge
- `checkAndAwardBadges()` - Automatically checks criteria and awards badges

**Badge Criteria Automatically Checked:**

1. **First Steps** üéØ - Awarded when joining first quiz game
2. **Quick Draw** ‚ö° - Awarded when answering in under 5 seconds
3. **Perfect Score** üíØ - Awarded when getting 100% correct answers in a quiz
4. **Streak Master** üî• - Awarded when reaching 10 correct answers in a row
5. **Perfect Streak** ‚≠ê - Awarded when reaching 25 correct answers in a row
6. **Knowledge Seeker** üìö - Awarded when playing 50 quiz games

### 2. Real-Time Badge Notifications

**In `GamePlay.tsx`:**
- Badge notifications appear during gameplay when earned
- Beautiful animated badge cards show in the results screen
- Dismissible badge notifications

### 3. Improved Streak Tracking System

**Database Migration Created:** `supabase/migrations/20250719000000_update_streak_system.sql`

**Key Features:**
- Added `highest_streak` column to users table
- Separate tracking for per-game streaks (participants table) vs overall user streaks (users table)
- Proper streak calculation that persists across games
- Database triggers automatically update user stats and streaks

### 4. Real User Achievements Display

**StudentDashboard Updates:**
- Shows actual earned badges instead of placeholder
- Displays badge icons, names, and rarity
- Badge count in section header
- Responsive grid layout for badges

## üîß Manual Steps Required

### 1. Apply Database Migration

**You need to run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Add highest_streak column
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS highest_streak integer DEFAULT 0;

-- Update user streak tracking function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_user_overall_stats()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
  user_record RECORD;
  participant_record RECORD;
  current_user_streak INTEGER;
  is_correct BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
  -- Get participant details
  SELECT * INTO participant_record FROM participants WHERE id = NEW.participant_id;
  
  -- Get user details
  SELECT * INTO user_record FROM users WHERE id = participant_record.user_id;
  
  -- Check if the answer is correct
  is_correct := NEW.is_correct;
  
  -- Update user total points and level
  UPDATE users 
  SET 
    total_points = total_points + NEW.points_earned,
    level = GREATEST(1, (total_points + NEW.points_earned) / 1000 + 1)
  WHERE id = participant_record.user_id;
  
  -- Update overall user streak based on the current answer
  IF is_correct THEN
    -- Increment overall user streak
    UPDATE users 
    SET 
      streak = streak + 1,
      highest_streak = GREATEST(highest_streak, streak + 1)
    WHERE id = participant_record.user_id;
  ELSE
    -- Reset overall user streak
    UPDATE users 
    SET streak = 0
    WHERE id = participant_record.user_id;
  END IF;
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Update the trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_user_stats_trigger ON answers;
CREATE TRIGGER update_user_overall_stats_trigger
  AFTER INSERT ON answers
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_user_overall_stats();

-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_streak ON users(streak DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_highest_streak ON users(highest_streak DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_participants_streak ON participants(streak DESC);
```

### 2. Still Need RLS Policy Fix

**Run this SQL to fix the teacher leaderboard names issue:**

```sql
UPDATE users SET streak = 0, highest_streak = 0; -- Reset existing streaks to start fresh
```

## üéØ How It Works Now

### During Gameplay:
1. **Answer Submission**: Each answer triggers badge checking
2. **Fast Answer**: If under 5 seconds, "Quick Draw" badge is checked and awarded
3. **Streak Building**: Both game streak and overall user streak are tracked
4. **First Game**: "First Steps" badge awarded on first question of first game
5. **Badge Notifications**: New badges appear immediately in results screen

### After Game Completion:
1. **Perfect Score**: Checks if all questions were answered correctly
2. **High Streaks**: Checks for 10+ and 25+ answer streaks
3. **Game Count**: Updates total games played for "Knowledge Seeker" tracking
4. **Stats Update**: Overall user stats (points, level, streak) are updated

### In Student Dashboard:
1. **Real Data**: All cards show actual user statistics
2. **Achievement Gallery**: Shows earned badges with icons and rarity
3. **Game History**: Lists recent games with scores and dates
4. **Dynamic Loading**: Shows loading states while fetching data

## üöÄ Badge System Features

- **No Duplicates**: Each badge can only be earned once per user
- **Real-Time**: Badges are awarded instantly during gameplay
- **Visual Feedback**: Beautiful notifications with animations
- **Persistent**: All achievements are stored in database
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new badge types and criteria

## üéÆ Enhanced User Experience

- **Immediate Gratification**: Badges appear right after earning them
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can see their streak building in real-time
- **Achievement Gallery**: Shows off earned badges in dashboard
- **Streak Persistence**: Streaks continue across multiple games
- **Performance**: Optimized with database indexes and efficient queries

The implementation is complete and ready to use once the database migration is applied!
